# cdt1d - Cat me if you can

--------------

## Objective: Teach and familiarise children from ages 7-12 the names of different animals

--------------


## How to play:

Unscramble the words as fast as possible to get the mouse back to his home.

The word theme is *Animals and Insects*!

**BUT WATCH OUT!**

*The Cat is chasing you!*

The faster a word is unscrambled, the faster the mouse goes! Make sure to not take too long on a question, or the cat will catch the mouse!

You can skip a question if it's too hard, however, the mouse will stumble and the cat will get even closer. A wrong answer will also cause the mouse to stumble, but not as much as skipping the question.

There are 3 levels of difficulty, increasing in length of words and rarity of animals.

If you go very fast, you might even leave the cat in the dust!

Try to get as quick a time as you possibly can, and earn a place in the *Hall of Fame*.
