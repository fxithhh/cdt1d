# cdt1d - Cat me if you can

--------------

## Objective: Teach and familiarise children from ages 7-12 the names of different animals

--------------


## How to play:

Unscramble the words as fast as possible to get the mouse back to his home.

The word theme is *Animals*!

The faster a word is unscrambled, the faster the mouse goes!

**BUT WATCH OUT!**

*The Cat is chasing you!*

Make sure to not take too long on a question, or the cat will catch the mouse!

You can skip a question if it's too hard, however, the mouse will stumble and the cat will get even closer. A wrong answer will also cause the mouse to stumble, but not as much as skipping the question.

There are 3 levels of difficulty, increasing in length of words and rarity of animals.

Try to get as high a score as you possibly can!
